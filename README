# üßæ AWS Billing Data Exporter

This Python script fetches monthly AWS billing data using the **AWS Cost Explorer API** and saves it into a **CSV file** for easy analysis.

It groups your AWS costs by service and region, rounding costs to two decimal places to match AWS invoice style.

---

## üì¶ Features

* Fetches **UnblendedCost** (matches AWS invoice rates minus discounts).
* Groups data by **Service** and **Region**.
* Rounds costs to **two decimal places** (AWS-style).
* Exports a clean **CSV report** with regions as rows and services as columns.
* Simple **CLI arguments** for month and year.

---

## üß∞ Requirements

* **Python 3.8+**
* **AWS CLI** configured with access to Cost Explorer.
* **AWS IAM permissions**: The executing user or role must have the following policy:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ce:GetCostAndUsage"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
````

## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone this repository:**

<!-- end list -->

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/aws-billing-exporter.git](https://github.com/yourusername/aws-billing-exporter.git)
cd aws-billing-exporter
```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

<!-- end list -->

```bash
pip install boto3
```

3.  **Configure AWS credentials:**

<!-- end list -->

```bash
aws configure
```

> **Note:** Make sure your configured AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to access the Cost Explorer API.

-----

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script with the desired month and year using the command-line interface:

```bash
python aws_billing_export.py --month 9 --year 2025
```

This will create a file named in the format `aws_billing_<year>_<month>.csv`.

### üß© Example CSV Naming

| Month | Year | Generated File |
| :---- | :--- | :------------- |
| 8     | 2025 | `aws_billing_2025_08.csv` |
| 9     | 2025 | `aws_billing_2025_09.csv` |
| 1     | 2024 | `aws_billing_2024_01.csv` |

### Example Output

| Region | AmazonEC2 | AmazonS3 | AWSLambda | ... |
| :----- | :-------- | :------- | :-------- | :-- |
| us-east-1 | 120.45 | 45.67 | 3.20 | ... |
| us-west-2 | 98.30 | 25.10 | 2.85 | ... |
| ap-south-1 | 76.00 | 15.50 | 1.10 | ... |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Script Details

The script is structured into three main functions:

1.  `fetch_billing_data(start_date, end_date)`: Fetches monthly cost data from AWS Cost Explorer for the given time range.
2.  `process_and_save_to_csv(response, file_name)`: Processes the API response and writes it to a CSV file, rounding each cost.
3.  `main()`: Handles argument parsing, date calculation, and execution flow.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

| Error Message | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Error: You are not authorized to perform ce:GetCostAndUsage** | ‚Üí Ensure your IAM user or role has the **correct permission** as outlined in the [Requirements](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23%25F0%259F%25A7%25A0-requirements) section. |
| **Error: Unable to locate credentials** | ‚Üí Run `aws configure` and set valid credentials. |
| **No data returned** | ‚Üí Make sure **Cost Explorer is enabled** in your AWS account and that you are querying a valid month (i.e., not a future month). |
